                    10 Endangered Ocean Species and Marine Animal
                </h1>
                <p>Our eco-system is comprised of interdependent animals and plants which constitute a complex web of life. This variety of life on earth, the biodiversity that features numerous interactions among the species, is most vital to the existence of our planet and, particularly, of humanity. Thus, indeed the extinction of a single species may affect the whole biological system pertaining to life and living things.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the improper interventions of human beings in nature are pushing several of the species in the ecosystem to the brink of extinction.</p>
                <p>The unprecedented unnatural extinction of these species has not only the endangered functioning of the ecosystem but also affected the ecological issues to a large extent.</p>
                <p>From unknown creatures to Charismatic megafauna, these disappearances in the ecosystem happen frequently. On land, animals like Orangutan, Black Rhinos, Amur Leopard and Giant Pandas are some of the most critically endangered species in the world.</p>
                <p>Similarly, many marine species including marine mammals, sea turtles and salmonids are also on the edge of extinction as climate change and overfishing become a major threat to their existence.</p>
                <img src="img1.jpg" alt="turtle" width="650" height="420" >
                <p>According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), hundreds of marine species across the world come under the categories of endangered and critically endangered species.</p>
                <p>IUCN, at regular intervals, determines the status of species considering the probability of their extinction, from least concern to extinct. Some of these majorly endangered and recognizable marine species are named here.</p>
                <p>Let’s take a look at ten endangered ocean species and marine animals.</p>
                <h2>1. Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricate)</h2>
                <img src="img2.jpg" alt="turtle" width="650" height="420" >
                <p>Found in the tropical regions of all the world’s oceans, gulfs and seas- mostly in coral reefs, the Hawksbill Turtle’s population has been estimated to have declined by 80% over the last century.</p>
                <p>Known to be a subject of heavy trafficking in the tourist trade in tropical regions for its meat and shells, these turtles are being killed mercilessly for quite a period of time.</p>
                <p>The colourful shells of the Hawksbill Turtle, with beautiful patterns, make them a valuable item in the market, often sold as “tortoiseshell.”</p>
                <p>Even though in many countries harvesting of its eggs is banned, the practice could not be ceased completely. The declination of its population has also resulted due to the degradation of coral reef species which the Hawksbill Turtle primarily feed on.</p>
                <p>According to marine conservatives, this family of the turtle is the living representatives of reptiles that have existed in our oceans for the past hundred million years and these turtles are vital for the existence of seagrass beds and coral reefs.</p>
                <h2>2. Vaquita (Phoeocna sinus)</h2>
                <img src="" alt="turtle" width="650" height="420" >
                <p>An inhabitant of the shallow, murky waters off the shore of the Baja Peninsula in Mexico, Vaquita is the world’s smallest and critically endangered cetacean.</p>
                <p>This rare marine mammal in the world is on the brink of extinction only after a half-century of its first sighting. Features of Vaquita include the dark rings around their eyes, lips with dark patches and a thin line from mouth to dorsal fins.</p>
                <p>Extensive use of gill-netting for fishing in the Gulf of California has endangered this marine species, resulting in a gradual drop in population since the 1940s.</p>
                <p>The gill-netting operation may have been ceased to exist in 1970, but the population fall persists for as much as 15% every year.</p>
                <p>According to reports, there is only a dozen of this marine mammal left in the world since the percentage of decline in their population was as much as 90% since 2011.</p>
                <h2>3. Blue Whale (Balaenopteramusculus)</h2>
                <img src="" alt="turtle" width="650" height="420" >
                <p>The largest living mammal on earth, the blue whale belongs to the baleen whales and features more than 100 feet in length and around 200 tonnes in weight.</p>
                <p>There are at least three subspecies of Blue whale and these could be found migrating from both poles in the oceans around the world. Sits on top of the food chain, whales have a significant role in maintaining a healthy marine environment.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, excessive commercial hunting has resulted in a decrease in its population drastically and now has posed a threat to its mere existence even though an international ban was constituted in 1966. According to IUCN’s 2016 estimate, the global population of the Blue Whale is 10,000–25,000.</p>
                <h2>4. Kemp’s Ridley Sea Turtle (Lepidochelys kempii)</h2>
                <img src="" alt="turtle" width="650" height="420" >
                <p>The Kemp’s Ridley sea turtle, also known as the Atlantic Ridley sea turtle, is a rarest and smallest sea turtle and is endangered to a severe degree.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the conditions such as loss of habitat, marine pollution and entanglement in fishing nets etc. have resulted in the huge decline of the population of the Kemp’s Ridley sea turtle.</p>
                <p>Thus, harvesting of eggs have been made illegal and research projects of incubating and hatching the eggs in temperature-controlled rooms have been undertaken to save this endangered marine species.</p>
